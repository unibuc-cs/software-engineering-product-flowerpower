### Scenarios:
#### 1. Ana, a social media content creator wants to share a photo from a recent photo shoot but doesn’t want it to stay on her profile permanently. She uploads the photo to Blinq24/1 and sets the visibility to her “close friends group”. The photo will remain visible for 24 hours and will only be accessible to the friends Ana has inside of the group. After 24 hours, the photo will be automatically deleted, and Ana doesn’t have to worry about it staying on the internet.
#### 2. Alex, a user who prioritizes privacy, wants to share a photo with his family members only. He creates a group on Blinq24/1 titled “Family” and adds the relevant members to it. When uploading the photo, he selects visibility settings to make it viewable only to the “Family” group. The photo is accessible only to the “Family” group members and will automatically be deleted after 24 hours, ensuring the privacy of his content.
#### 3. Maria, a new user looking for a quick experience, downloads the Blinq24/1 app and registers. After authenticating, she can start uploading photos immediately. The app’s interface guides her through the process, allowing her to set her desired audience. Maria enjoys an intuitive and simple experience, making it easy to quickly share temporary photos without complicated privacy settings.
#### 4.	Eusebiu Vicentiu, a businessman who interacts with multiple groups of people ,on a daily basis, wants an easier way of sending different photos to different groups without having to worry about showing the wrong people his photos. Before sending the photo he either creates a group or chooses one that he already created , in which he can select which people are part of that group from his friends list. This allows him to send a photo to multiple people that do not know each at once without having to do so separately.
